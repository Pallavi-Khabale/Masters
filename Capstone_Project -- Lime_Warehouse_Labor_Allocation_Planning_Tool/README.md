# 📦 Masters Capstone Project — Warehouse Operations & Labor Allocation for Lime

This repository documents the learnings and structure of my capstone project for the Master's in Supply Chain Management at the **University of Washington – Foster School of Business**. The project focused on optimizing **warehouse operations and labor planning** for **Lime**, a global leader in micro-mobility solutions.

🎓 Capstone Project | Foster School of Business, University of Washington  
🟢 Lean Six Sigma Green Belt Certified | March 2025 – June 2025

## 📌 Project Overview

This project was completed as part of my master's capstone in Supply Chain Management at the University of Washington. The goal was to optimize warehouse labor allocation planning for Lime Commerce Warehouse by developing a dynamic dashboard that forecasts labor needs per process based on historical data trends such as SKU complexity, order types, and shipment data.

> **Impact**  
> - Improved forecasted labor accuracy and reduced idle time by **20%** across inbound and outbound activities.  
> - Enhanced warehouse labor efficiency through a **dynamic, no-code planning tool** that forecasted staffing needs using real-time SKU, takt time, and volume trends.  
> - Replaced static benchmarks with **data-driven regression models**, enabling agile and function-specific labor allocation across core fulfillment tasks.
